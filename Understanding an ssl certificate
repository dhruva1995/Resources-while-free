SSL Cerificate:
  version : version of the X.509 certificate.
  Serial Number : A number that uniquely identifies the certificate and is issued by the certification authority.
  Signature Algoritm :  SignatureAlgorithm is the algorithm used to sign the content using the private key
  Signature Hash Algoritm : SignatureHashAlgorithm is used to hash the content before signing
  Issuer : Subject of the Issuer.
  valid Ffrom : not Before 
  validate to : not after
  Subject : subject of the end entity
  Public Key : n in RSA Algorithm.
  Public Key Parameter : holds an elliptic curve in ECDSA Certificate (typically is 00 05 means 0 in DER)
  SAN : Holds Subject alternative name
     SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames

     GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

     GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
        otherName                       [0]     OtherName,
        rfc822Name                      [1]     IA5String,
        dNSName                         [2]     IA5String,
        x400Address                     [3]     ORAddress,
        directoryName                   [4]     Name,
        ediPartyName                    [5]     EDIPartyName,
        uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IA5String,
        iPAddress                       [7]     OCTET STRING,
        registeredID                    [8]     OBJECT IDENTIFIER
     }
   
  Basic constrains:
    Subject Type=End Entity        : Holds a value either of (CA or End Entity) meaning the party this cert belongs is a CA or an End User
    Path Length Constraint=None    : Number of CA certs that be present Under this cert.
