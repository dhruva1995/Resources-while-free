SSL Cerificate:
  version : version of the X.509 certificate.
  Serial Number : A number that uniquely identifies the certificate and is issued by the certification authority.
  Signature Algoritm :  SignatureAlgorithm is the algorithm used to sign the content using the private key
  Signature Hash Algoritm : SignatureHashAlgorithm is used to hash the content before signing
  Issuer : Subject of the Issuer.
  valid Ffrom : not Before 
  validate to : not after
  Subject : subject of the end entity
  Public Key : n in RSA Algorithm.
  Public Key Parameter : holds an elliptic curve in ECDSA Certificate (typically is 00 05 means 0 in DER)
  SAN : Holds Subject alternative name
     SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames

     GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

     GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
        otherName                       [0]     OtherName,
        rfc822Name                      [1]     IA5String,
        dNSName                         [2]     IA5String,
        x400Address                     [3]     ORAddress,
        directoryName                   [4]     Name,
        ediPartyName                    [5]     EDIPartyName,
        uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IA5String,
        iPAddress                       [7]     OCTET STRING,
        registeredID                    [8]     OBJECT IDENTIFIER
     }
   
  Basic constrains:
    Subject Type=End Entity        : Holds a value either of (CA or End Entity) meaning the party this cert belongs is a CA or an End User
    Path Length Constraint=None    : Number of CA certs that be present Under this cert.

  Subject Key Identifier (SKI):
    Subject Key Identifier extension provides a means of identifying certificates that contain a particular public key.  This is a hash value of the SSL certificate.
    
  Key Usage:
    The Key Usage extensions define what a particular certificate may be used for (assuming the application can parse this extension).         The following extensions are included in an SSL certificate:

      Digital Signature: (Taken from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) The digitalSignature bit is asserted when the subject public    key is used with a digital signature mechanism to support security services other than certificate signing (bit 5), or CRL signing (bit 6). Digital signature mechanisms are often used for entity authentication and data origin authentication with integrity.

      Key Encipherment: (Taken from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) The keyEncipherment bit is asserted when the subject public key is used for key transport. An example of Key Encipherment is the SSL handshake, where the two applications use asymmetric encryption to wrap around the exchange of a secret key that is ultimately used for the session.
      
      
  CRL Distribution Points:
      The CRL Distribution Points extension provides the location of the corresponding Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for the SSL certificate.
      
      
   Certificate Policies:
     The Certificate Policies extension defines the legal rules associated with a particular certificateâ€™s usage.
     
   Extended Key Usage (EKU):
    This extension indicates one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes already indicated in the key usage extension.  Symantec SSL Certificates include the following extensions:

    Server Authentication: (Taken from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) TLS WWW server authentication. Key usage bits that may be consistent: digitalSignature, keyEncipherment or keyAgreement

    Client Authentication: (Taken from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) TLS WWW client authentication. Key usage bits that may be consistent: digitalSignature and/or keyAgreement

   Authority Key Identifier (AKI): Link to parent (CA).  This AKI value would match the SKI value of the Intermediate CA certificate.

  Authority Info Access: The Authority Info Access extension provides information about how to access information about a CA, such as OCSP validation and CA policy data.


  Thumbprint: This extension provides the actual hash to ensure that the certificate has not been tampered with.
